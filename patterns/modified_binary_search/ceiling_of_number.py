'''Problem:
Given an array of numbers sorted in an ascending order, find the ceiling of a given number key.
The ceiling of the key will be the smallest element in the given array greater than or equal to the key.

Write a function to return the index of the ceiling of the key. If there isnâ€™t any ceiling return -1.

Input: [4, 6, 10], key = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest number greater than or equal to 6 is 6 having index 1.

Input: [1, 3, 8, 10, 15], key = 12
Output: 4
Explanation: The smallest number greater than or equal to 12 is 15 having index 4.

Input: [4, 6, 10], key = 17
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no number greater than or equal to 17 in the given array.

Input: [4, 6, 10], key = -1
Output: 0
Explanation: The smallest number greater than or equal to -1 is 4 having index 0.
