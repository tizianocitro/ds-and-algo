'''Problem:
Given an array of numbers sorted in an ascending order, find the ceiling of a given number key.
The ceiling of the key will be the smallest element in the given array greater than or equal to the key.

Write a function to return the index of the ceiling of the key.
If there isnâ€™t any ceiling return -1.
Return the smallest index in case of repeated ceilings.

Input: [4, 6, 6, 6, 10], key = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest number greater than or equal to 6 at the smallest index is 6 having index 1.

Input: [4, 5, 5, 7, 7, 10], key = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest number greater than or equal to 6 at the smallest index is 7 having index 3.
