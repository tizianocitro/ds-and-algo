'''Problem:
Given a string and a list of words, find all the starting indices of substrings in the given string that are a concatenation of all the given words exactly once without any overlapping of words.
It is given that all words are of the same length.

Input: string = "catfoxcat", words = ["cat", "fox"]  
Output: [0, 3]  
Explanation: The two substring containing both the words are "catfox" & "foxcat".

Input: string = "catcatfoxfox", words = ["cat", "fox"]  
Output: [3]
Explanation: The only substring containing both the words is "catfox".

# solution one
# Complexity:
# O(n * m * l) time - where n is the number of characters in the string, m is the number of words, and l is the length of a word
# O(m) space - because, at most, we will be storing all the words in the two dictionaries
# In the worst case, we also need O(n) space for the resulting result_indices list, so the overall space complexity of the algorithm will be O(n + m).

        #Â This optimization helps avoid unnecessary iterations.
        # Consider only the indexes that can produce a substring long enough
        # to be a concatenation of the words, so if we have a string long 15
        # and 2 words of 3 characters we will not range over the last 5 indexes
        # because to be a concatenation a substring must have at least 6 characters.
        # Adding 1 accounts for the possibility of starting the concatenation at the very end of str1
