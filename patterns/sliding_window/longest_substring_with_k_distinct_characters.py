'''Problem:
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.

You can assume that K is less than or equal to the length of the given string.

Input: string = "araaci", k = 2
Output: 4  
Explanation: The longest substring with no more than 2 distinct characters is "araa".

# solution one
