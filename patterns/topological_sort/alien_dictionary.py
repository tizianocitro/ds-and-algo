'''Problem:
There is a dictionary containing words from an alien language for which we donâ€™t know the ordering of the letters.

Given a list of strings words from the alien language's dictionary.
All strings in words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of this new language.
Each word consists of only lowercase English letters.

Return a string of the unique letters in the new alien language sorted in lexicographically increasing order by the new language's rules.

It is given that the input is a valid dictionary and there exists an ordering among its letters.

Input: Words: ["ba", "bc", "ac", "cab"]
Output: bac
Explanation: Given that the words are sorted lexicographically by the rules of the alien language, so
from the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
1. From "ba" and "bc", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'c'.
2. From "bc" and "ac", we can conclude that 'b' comes before 'a'
From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "bac"

Input: Words: ["cab", "aaa", "aab"]
Output: cab
Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
1. From "cab" and "aaa", we can conclude that 'c' comes before 'a'.
2. From "aaa" and "aab", we can conclude that 'a' comes before 'b'
From the above two points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "cab"

Input: Words: ["ywx", "wz", "xww", "xz", "zyy", "zwz"]
Output: ywxz
Explanation: From the given words we can conclude the following ordering among its characters:
1. From "ywx" and "wz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'.
2. From "wz" and "xww", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'x'.
3. From "xww" and "xz", we can conclude that 'w' comes before 'z'
4. From "xz" and "zyy", we can conclude that 'x' comes before 'z'
5. From "zyy" and "zwz", we can conclude that 'y' comes before 'w'
From the above five points, we can conclude that the correct character order is: "ywxz"
