''' Problem:
Given an array with positive numbers and a positive target number, find all of its contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target number.

Input: [2, 5, 3, 10], target = 30
Output: [[2], [5], [2, 5], [3], [5, 3], [10]] // There are six contiguous subarrays whose product is less than the target.
'''

# solution one with sliding window
# Complexity:
# O(N^3) time - N for the outer loop and N for the inner loop (list() is O(N))
# O(N) space - for the result list
'''
If we do not ignore the space required for the output list, the algorithm needs more space which is used for the contiguos list.

For an array with distinct elements, finding all of its contiguous subarrays
is like finding the number of ways to choose two indices, i and j, in the array such that i <= j.

If there are a total of n elements in the array, here is how we can count all the contiguous subarrays:
- When i = 0, j can have any value from 0 to n-1, giving a total of n choices.
- When i = 1, j can have any value from 1 to n-1, giving a total of n-1 choices.
- Similarly, when i = 2, j can have n-2 choices.
- When i = n-1, j can only have only 1 choice.
Combining all the choices we get: [n * (n + 1)] / 2.
So, at most, we need space for O(N^2) output lists, making our space complexity O(N^3).
