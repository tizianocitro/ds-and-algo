# 0/1 Knapsack Pattern

0/1 Knapsack pattern is based on the famous problem with the same name which is efficiently solved using **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

In this pattern, there is a set of problems that helps in developing an understanding of DP. By firstly solving them with a brute-force recursive solution, it is possible to see the overlapping subproblems, i.e., realizing that we are solving the same problems repeatedly. After the recursive solution, we will modify the algorithm to apply advanced techniques of **Memoization** and **Bottom-Up Dynamic Programming** to develop a complete understanding of this pattern.
