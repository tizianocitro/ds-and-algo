# Island

Many coding interview problems involve traversing 2D arrays (aka matrix or grid). The Island pattern describes all the efficient ways to traverse a matrix. This pattern will go through many problems to explain matrix traversal using **Depth First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth First Search (BFS)** approaches and their variants.
