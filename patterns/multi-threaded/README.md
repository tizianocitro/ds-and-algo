# Multi-threaded

In many algorithms, concurrency and thread safety are very important. In technical interviews, we can apply these concepts to coding problems to stand out.

Thread safety can be easily added to any algorithm that uses multiple threads.

Algorithms can be made multi-threaded to perform multiple concurrent tasks or to perform pre-fetching or post-processing functions to speed things up.
