'''Problem:
Given the head of a LinkedList and two positions p and q, reverse the LinkedList from position p to q.

Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> None, p = 2, q = 4
Output: 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> None

'''Similar problems:
Problem 1: Reverse the first k elements of a given LinkedList.
Solution: This problem can be easily converted to the parent problem; to reverse the first k nodes of the list, we need to pass p=1 and q=k.

Problem 2: Given a LinkedList with n nodes, reverse it based on its size in the following way:
- If n is even, reverse the list in a group of n/2 nodes.
- If n is odd, keep the middle node as it is, reverse the first n/2 nodes and reverse the last n/2 nodes.
Solution:
When n is even we can perform the following steps:
1. Reverse first n/2 nodes: head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)
2. Reverse last n/2 nodes: head = reverse(head, n/2 + 1, n)
When n is odd, our algorithm will look like:
1. head = reverse(head, 1, n/2)
2. head = reverse(head, n/2 + 2, n)
In the second step, weâ€™re skipping two elements as we will be skipping the middle element if n is odd.
