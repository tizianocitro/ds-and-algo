''' Problem:
Given the head of a Singly LinkedList that contains a cycle, write a function to find the starting node of the cycle.
'''

''' Solution:
If we know the length of the LinkedList cycle, we can find the start of the cycle through the following steps:
    1. Take two pointers: pointer1 and pointer2;
    2. Initialize both pointers to point to the start of the LinkedList;
    3. We need to find the length of the LinkedList cycle;
    4. Letâ€™s assume that the length of the cycle is K nodes. Move pointer2 ahead by K nodes;
    5. Now, keep incrementing pointer1 and pointer2 until they both meet:
    6. As pointer2 is K nodes ahead of pointer1, which means, pointer2 must have completed one loop in the cycle when both pointers meet.
The meeting point will be the start of the cycle.
