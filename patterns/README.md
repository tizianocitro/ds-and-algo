# Patterns Cheat Sheet

Brief description of all the coding patterns in this folder.

## Two Pointers

**Description**: This method uses two pointers to traverse an array or a list from different ends or directions.

**Problems**: 'Number of Islands', 'Max Area of Island', 'Flood Fill'.

## Fast & Slow Pointers

**Description**: In this method, two pointers move at different speeds in a data structure.
**Usage**: It is commonly used to detect cycles in a structure, find middle elements, or to solve other specific problems related to linked lists.
**Problems**: 'LinkedList Cycle', 'Middle of the LinkedList', 'Palindrome LinkedList'.

## Sliding Window

**Description**: This pattern involves creating a 'window' into the data structure and then moving that window around to gather specific information.
**Usage**: Mostly used in array or list-based problems where you need to find a contiguous subset that fulfills certain conditions.
**Problems**: 'Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K', 'Smallest Subarray with a given sum', 'Longest Substring with K Distinct Characters'.

## Merge Intervals

**Description**: This pattern involves merging overlapping intervals.
**Usage**: Often used in problems involving time intervals, ranges, or sequences.
**Problems**: 'Merge Intervals', 'Insert Interval', 'Intervals Intersection'.

## Cyclic Sort

**Description**: This pattern involves sorting an array containing numbers in a given range.
**Usage**: It's useful in situations where the data involves a finite range of natural numbers.
**Problems**: 'Cyclic Sort', 'Find the Missing Number', 'Find all Duplicates'.

## In-place Reversal of a Linked List

**Description**: This pattern involves reversing elements of a linked list in-place.
**Usage**: It's generally used when reversing a sequence without using extra space.
**Problems**: 'Reverse a LinkedList', 'Reverse a Sub-list', 'Reverse Every K-element Sub-list'.

## Tree Breadth First Search

**Description**: This pattern involves level-by-level traversal of a tree.
**Usage**: It's used when we need to traverse a tree or graph in a level-by-level (breadth-first) manner.
**Problems**: 'Level Order Traversal', 'Reverse Level Order Traversal', 'Zigzag Traversal'.

## Tree Depth First Search

**Description**: This pattern involves traversing a tree or graph depth-wise before visiting siblings or neighbors.
**Usage**: It's used when you need to search deeper into a tree/graph first before going across.
**Problems**: 'Binary Tree Path Sum', 'All Paths for a Sum', 'Count Paths for a Sum'.

## Two Heaps

**Description**: This pattern involves using two heaps to divide a set of numbers into two parts.
**Usage**: It's useful when you need to find median numbers in a sequence, or other similar problems.
**Problems**: 'Find the Median of a Number Stream', 'Sliding Window Median', 'Maximize Capital'.

## Subsets

**Description**: This pattern involves generating all subsets of a set.
**Usage**: It's helpful for solving problems that require exploring all subsets of a given set.
**Problems**: 'Subsets', 'Subsets With Duplicates', 'Permutations'.

## Modified Binary Search

**Description**: This is a tweaked version of the binary search algorithm.
**Usage**: It's used when a simple binary search isn't sufficient, like finding a number in a bitonic array.
**Problems**: 'Order-agnostic Binary Search', 'Ceiling of a Number', 'Next Letter'.

## Top K Elements

**Description**: This pattern is used to find the top K elements among a certain category.
**Usage**: It's commonly used in problems involving sorting, searching, and in heap data structures.
**Problems**: 'Top K Frequent Numbers', 'Kth Largest Number in a Stream', 'Top K Frequent Elements'.

## Bitwise XOR

**Description**: This pattern involves the use of Bitwise XOR to solve various array-based problems.
**Usage**: It's used when we need to manipulate and compare bits directly.
**Problems**: 'Single Number', 'Two Single Numbers', 'Complement of Base 10 Number'.

## Backtracking

**Description**: This pattern involves exploring all possible solutions and then backtracking to correct the course whenever you're on the wrong path.
**Usage**: It's typically used for solving complex combinatorial problems, puzzles, and games.
**Problems**: 'Sudoku Solver', 'N-Queens', 'Generate Parentheses'.

## 0/1 Knapsack (Dynamic Programming)

**Description**: This pattern deals with problems where items have different values and weights, and we need to determine the maximum value we can carry.
**Usage**: It's typically used in optimization problems, especially those involving physical constraints.
**Problems**: '0/1 Knapsack', 'Equal Subset Sum Partition', 'Subset Sum'.

## Topological Sort (Graph)

**Description**: This pattern involves sorting nodes in a directed graph in a specific order where the preceding node comes before the following node.
**Usage**: It's used for scheduling problems and in scenarios where order needs to be imposed on how you process nodes.
**Problems**: 'Task Scheduling Order', 'All Tasks Scheduling Orders', 'Alien Dictionary'.

## K-way Merge

**Description**: This pattern involves merging K sorted lists.
**Usage**: It's typically used in problems involving lists, where merging is required.
**Problems**: 'Merge K Sorted Lists', 'Kth Smallest Number in M Sorted Lists', 'Smallest Number Range'.

## Monotonic Stack

**Description**: This pattern involves using a stack to maintain a monotonic (either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing) order of elements.
**Usage**: It's often used for solving problems where you need to find the next greater or smaller elements.
**Problems**: 'Next Greater Element', 'Next Smaller Element', 'Largest Rectangle in Histogram'.

## Multi-threaded

**Description**: This pattern involves designing algorithms that can execute multiple threads in parallel.
**Usage**: It's used in situations where a task can be divided into independent sub-tasks that can execute concurrently.
**Problems**: 'Invert Binary Tree', 'Binary Search Tree Iterator', 'Same Tree'.

## Union Find

**Description**: Union Find, also known as Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is a data structure that keeps track of a partition of a set into disjoint subsets.
**Usage**: This pattern is particularly useful for problems where we need to find whether 2 elements belong to the same group or need to solve connectivity-related problems in a graph or tree.
**Problems**: 'Graph Redundant Connection', 'Number of Provinces', 'Is Graph Bipartite'.
