'''Problem:
Find the path with the maximum sum in a given binary tree. Write a function that returns the maximum sum.

A path can be defined as a sequence of nodes between any two nodes and doesnâ€™t necessarily pass through the root.
The path must contain at least one node.

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, None, 5, 6]
Output: 16
Explanation: The path with the maximum sum is: [4, 2, 1, 3, 6]
