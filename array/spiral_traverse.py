# !difficulty: medium

# Write a function that takes in an n x m two-dimensional array (that can be square-shaped when n == m)
# and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in spiral order.

# Spiral order starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes to the right,
# and proceeds in a spiral pattern all the way until every element has been visited.

# Input:
# array = [
#    [1,  2,  3,  4],
#    [12, 13, 14, 5],
#    [11, 16, 15, 6],
#    [10, 9,  8,  7],
# ]

# Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]

# Complexity
# 0(n) time where n is the total number of elements in the array (rows * cols)
# 0(n) space where n is the total number of elements in the array (rows * cols)
