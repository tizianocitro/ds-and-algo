# !difficulty: easy

# Traverse the input array, swapping any two numbers that are out of order and keeping track of any swaps that you make.
# Once you arrive at the end of the array, check if you have made any swaps;
# if not, the array is sorted and you are done;
# otherwise, repeat the steps laid out in this hint until the array is sorted.

# Complexity
#Â Best: O(n) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
# Average: O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array
# Worst: O(n^2) time | O(1) space - where n is the length of the input array

# solution one
