# Merge Sort works by cutting an array in two halves, respectively sorting those two halves by performing some special logic,
# and then merging the two newly-sorted halves into one sorted array.
# The respective sorting of the two halves is done by reapplying the Merge Sort algorithm / logic on each half until single-element halves are obtained;
# these single-element arrays are sorted by nature and can very easily be merged back together.

# Divide the input array in two halves by finding the middle-most index in the array and slicing the two halves around that index.
# Then, recursively apply Merge Sort to each half, and finally merge them into one single,
# sorted array by iterating through their values and progressively adding them to the new array in ascending order.

# Your implementation of Merge Sort almost certainly uses a lot of auxiliary space and likely does not sort the input array in place.
# What is the space complexity of your algorithm? Can you implement a version of the algorithm using only one additional array of the same length as the input array,
# and can this version sort the input array in place?

# Complexity
# Best: O(nlog(n)) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array
# Average: O(nlog(n) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array
# Worst: O(nlog(n)) time | O(n) space - where n is the length of the input array 
# Memory is n instead of nlog(n) because we create a single array at the start, which is a copy of the original array,
# so we can ignore the log(n) coming from recursion. In fact, it would be O(n + log(n))
