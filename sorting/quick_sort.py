# Quick Sort works by picking a "pivot" number from an array,
# positioning every other number in the array in sorted order with respect to the pivot
# (all smaller numbers to the pivot's left; all bigger numbers to the pivot's right),
# and then repeating the same two steps on both sides of the pivot until the entire array is sorted.

# Pick a random number from the input array (the first number, for instance) and let that number be the pivot.
# Iterate through the rest of the array using two pointers,
# one starting at the left extremity of the array and progressively moving to the right,
# and the other one starting at the right extremity of the array and progressively moving to the left.
# As you iterate through the array, compare the left and right pointer numbers to the pivot.
# If the left number is greater than the pivot and the right number is less than the pivot, swap them;
# this will effectively sort these numbers with respect to the pivot at the end of the iteration.
# If the left number is ever less than or equal to the pivot, increment the left pointer;
# similarly, if the right number is ever greater than or equal to the pivot, decrement the right pointer.
# Do this until the pointers pass each other, at which point swapping the pivot with the right number should position the pivot in its final, sorted position,
# where every number to its left is smaller and every number to its right is greater.

#Â Repeat the process mentioned prviously on the respective subarrays located to the left and right of your pivot,
# and keep on repeating the process thereafter until the input array is fully sorted.

# Complexity
# Best: O(nlog(n)) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the length of the input array
# Average: O(nlog(n) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the length of the input array
# Worst: O(n^2) time | O(log(n)) space - where n is the length of the input array (due to bad pivot choice)
