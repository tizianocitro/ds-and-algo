# !difficulty: hard, !from: https://www.algoexpert.io/questions/quick-sort

# Quick Sort works by picking a "pivot" number from an array,
# positioning every other number in the array in sorted order with respect to the pivot
# (all smaller numbers to the pivot's left; all bigger numbers to the pivot's right),
# and then repeating the same two steps on both sides of the pivot until the entire array is sorted.

# Pick a random number from the input array (the first number, for instance) and let that number be the pivot.
# Iterate through the rest of the array using two pointers,
# one starting at the left extremity of the array and progressively moving to the right,
# and the other one starting at the right extremity of the array and progressively moving to the left.
# As you iterate through the array, compare the left and right pointer numbers to the pivot.
# If the left number is greater than the pivot and the right number is less than the pivot, swap them;
# this will effectively sort these numbers with respect to the pivot at the end of the iteration.
# If the left number is ever less than or equal to the pivot, increment the left pointer;
# similarly, if the right number is ever greater than or equal to the pivot, decrement the right pointer.
# Do this until the pointers pass each other, at which point swapping the pivot with the right number should position the pivot in its final, sorted position,
# where every number to its left is smaller and every number to its right is greater.

#Â Repeat the process mentioned prviously on the respective subarrays located to the left and right of your pivot,
# and keep on repeating the process thereafter until the input array is fully sorted.

'''Solution (known as Median of Medians):
Median of Medians algorithm allows us to choose a good pivot for the partitioning algorithm of the Quicksort. This algorithm finds an
approximate median of an array in linear time O(n). When this approximate median is used as the pivot, the worst-case complexity of the
partitioning procedure reduces to linear O(n), which is also the asymptotically optimal worst-case complexity of any sorting/selection algorithm.
This algorithm was originally developed by Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, and Tarjan and was describe in their 1973 paper.

This is how the selction of the pivot using the Median of Medians algorithm works:
- If we have 5 or less than 5 elements in the input array, we simply take its first element as the pivot.
  If not then we divide the input array into subarrays of five elements (for simplicity we can ignore any subarray having less than five elements).
- Sort each subarray to determine its median. Sorting a small and fixed numbered array takes constant time.
  At the end of this step, we have an array containing medians of all the subarray.
- Recursively call the partitioning algorithm on the array containing medians until we get our pivot.
- Every time the partition procedure needs to find a pivot, it will follow the above three steps.
