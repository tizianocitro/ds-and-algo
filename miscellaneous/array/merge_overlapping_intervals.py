# Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of arbitrary intervals,
# merges any overlapping intervals, and returns the new intervals in no particular order.
# Each interval interval is an array of two integers,
# with interval[0] as the start of the interval and interval[1] as the end of the interval.
# Note that back-to-back intervals aren't considered to be overlapping.
# For example, [1, 5] and [6, 7] aren't overlapping;
# however, [1, 6] and [6, 7] are indeed overlapping.
#Â Also note that the start of any particular interval will always be less than or equal to the end of that interval.

# Input:
# intervals = [[1, 2], [3, 5], [4, 7], [6, 8], [9, 10]]
# Output:
# [[1, 2], [3, 8], [9, 10]] // Merge the intervals [3, 5], [4, 7], and [6, 8].

# Complexity
# O(nlog(n)) time - where n is the number of intervals
