'''Problem:
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top:
    1. 1 step + 1 step
    2. 2 steps

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top:
    1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
    2. 1 step + 2 steps
    3. 2 steps + 1 step
